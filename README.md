## Usage

### Adding a New Page

To add a new page, create a new `.astro` file in the `src/pages` directory.

Example:

```astro
---
import Layout from '../layouts/Layout.astro';
---

<Layout title="New Page">
  <h1>New Page</h1>
  <p>This is a new page.</p>
</Layout>
```

## Important

Due to the static and island based nature of Astro, a lot of Shadcn components won't work out of the box, 
some components such as the Avatar require more work on your side to enable them to work (see `src/components/Avatar.tsx`).

You can find useful information on this from the following links:
