        <div class="prose prose-lg max-w-none">
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Cognitive Design is the practice of creating interfaces that align with how the human mind naturally processes information. 
            It's about reducing cognitive load, making interactions predictable, and ensuring that users can focus on their goals 
            rather than figuring out how to use your interface.
          </p>
          <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
            Good cognitive design is invisible—users shouldn't have to think about how to interact with your product. 
            Every element, every transition, and every piece of feedback should feel natural and expected.

    <!-- Core Principles -->
    <section class="px-16 py-16 bg-[#F1F1F1]">
      <div class="max-w-4xl">
        <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-black mb-10">Core Principles</h2>
        
        <div class="space-y-8">
          <!-- Principle 1 -->
          <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded-2xl">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-3">1. Reduce Cognitive Load</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Minimize the amount of mental effort required to use your interface. Break complex tasks into simple steps, 
              use familiar patterns, and eliminate unnecessary choices. Every decision point adds cognitive burden, 
              so make interfaces that guide users naturally toward their goals.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Principle 2 -->
          <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded-2xl">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-3">2. Provide Clear Feedback</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Users should always know what's happening and what will happen next. Every action should have a clear, 
              immediate response. Use visual, auditory, or haptic feedback to confirm actions, indicate progress, 
              and communicate system state. Uncertainty creates anxiety and reduces trust.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Principle 3 -->
          <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded-2xl">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-3">3. Maintain Consistency</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Consistent interfaces are predictable interfaces. Use the same visual language, interaction patterns, 
              and terminology throughout your product. When users learn one part of your interface, 
              that knowledge should transfer to every other part.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Principle 4 -->
          <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded-2xl">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-3">4. Design for Recognition, Not Recall</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Make options visible rather than requiring users to remember them. Use clear labels, icons, 
              and visual cues to help users recognize what they can do. Recognition is much easier than recall—
              show users their options rather than expecting them to remember commands or workflows.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Principle 5 -->
          <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded-2xl">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-3">5. Respect Mental Models</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Design interfaces that match how users already think about the world. Leverage existing mental models 
              from real-world objects and familiar digital patterns. When your interface aligns with users' 
              expectations, it feels intuitive and requires no learning curve.
            </p>
          </div>

          <!-- Principle 6 -->
          <div class="bg-white p-8 rounded-2xl">
            <h3 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-black mb-3">6. Use Progressive Disclosure</h3>
            <p class="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
              Show only what users need in the moment. Hide advanced features and options until they're needed. 
              This keeps interfaces clean and focused while still providing power when required. 
              Start simple and reveal complexity gradually as users need it.

            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-2">Clear Visual Hierarchy</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Use size, weight, color, and spacing to create clear importance relationships. 
              Users should immediately understand what's most important on any screen.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="border-l-4 border-black pl-6">
            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-2">Meaningful Motion</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Use animation to provide continuity between states, direct attention, and explain spatial relationships. 
              Motion should always have a purpose—never animate just for decoration.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="border-l-4 border-black pl-6">
            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-2">Contextual Awareness</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Present the right information and actions based on context. What's relevant now? 
              What will the user need next? Anticipate needs and surface them at the right moment.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="border-l-4 border-black pl-6">
            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-2">Error Prevention & Recovery</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Design to prevent errors before they happen. When errors do occur, provide clear, 
              helpful messages and easy paths to recovery. Never blame the user.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div class="border-l-4 border-black pl-6">
            <h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-black mb-2">Accessible by Default</h4>
            <p class="text-gray-700">
              Cognitive design and accessibility go hand in hand. Clear, simple interfaces benefit everyone. 
              Design for diverse abilities, contexts, and needs from the start.
